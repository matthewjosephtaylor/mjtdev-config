# MJT config

A place for all of my opinionated configurations so that I access them everywhere.

dot files, json/yaml config files, etc...

Every tool/lib has a way to configure itself to better suite the tool-holder. 

These are my configurations, feel free to take a peek at what I currently think is the best config for all the things.

When sourceing `set -a` is your friend.
